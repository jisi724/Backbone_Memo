# Backbone_Memo
<strong>key words: backbone, leancloud, restful, single-page web app</strong>

This is demo for a super basic, but also important backbone.js based single page web app<br/>
All the basic operations like add, delete and modify can be done with this memo app<br/>
Model is responsible to communicate with database (leancloud)<br/>
View is used to dynamically show the layout in terms of the change of model<br/>
Router makes sure different functions can be done in the same page (no refresh needed)<br/>

Still need to be improved :)
