# Backbone_Memo
key words: backbone, leancloud, restful, single-page web app

This is demo for a super basic, but also important backbone.js based single page web app
All the basic operations like add, delete and modify can be done with this memo app
Model is responsible to communicate with database (leancloud)
View is used to dynamically show the layout in terms of the change of model
Router makes sure different functions can be done in the same page (no refresh needed)

Still need to be improved :)
